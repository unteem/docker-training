# Docker Basics



## Terminology

 - image
 - layer
 - container
 - Dockerfile
 - registry 


## Image

An image is a state of a file system.
It is the rootfs and everything you put on it like libs, bin...
You can think of it as the folder where you chroot.

## Layer

A layer is a set of data you can add to another layer.
Together they can form an image.
You can think of it as the commit in a git history

## Container

A container is a running image.

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands you would normally execute manually in order to build a Docker image.

## Registry

Docker Registry stores and distributes images centrally. It's where you push images to and pull them from.

## Illustration of Basics

Hands on!


## image/layer/registry/container

`docker run alpine:3.5 echo hello world`


## Dockerfile

```bash
cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
FROM alpine:3.5
CMD echo hello world
EOF

docker build -t myimage .
docker run myimage
```
